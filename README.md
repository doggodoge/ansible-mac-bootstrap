# Ansible macOS Bootstrap

This is to get up and going for macOS with the development tools I want.

cd into this repo directory

```shell
./install.sh
```

And then you should have a nice new configured install to play with. If you use
this for yourself I would recommend changing `tasks/git.yml` to reflect your
github username and email.
